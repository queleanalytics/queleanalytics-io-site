<h1 id="1-quelea-context-and-genesis">1: QueleA, Context and genesis</h1>

<p><img src="/images/quelea_context_genese.png" alt="" />
<p style="color:red"> QueleA ! </p>
QueleA was born within my experience in data analytics. What is my experience in data Analytics ?<br />
The almost systematic failure of teams and analytics projects in business.<br />
QueleA&rsquo;s goal is to help in the transition towards digital transformation by building a sustainable &ldquo;Analytics&rdquo; way of thinking.</p>

<p><p style="color:red"> And why the name QueleA ?</p>
Since I was kid, I am fascinated by this little bird :Quelea. Its weight is between 15 and 20 g and it measures between 12 to 13 cm long, it is also called red-beaked worker. I could sit for hours watching them. See their determination, their tenacity to overcome their goals. A tireless bird, deploying all its energy continuously at work, the Quelea is a species known for it&rsquo;s resistance.</p>

<p><p style="color:red"> Little bird, huge impacts </p>
Although they prefer the seeds of wild grasses to those of cultivated plants, these birds represent, because of their large numbers, a constant threat to fields of sorghum, wheat, barley, millet and rice. The quelea eats an average of 10 grams of seed a day - about half of its weight - which means that a colony of two million can eat up to 20 tons of seeds in one day, whole fields alone.</p>

<p><p style="color:red"> Some figures and studies </p>
Despite all the efforts and investments put in place, it is clear that companies are very reluctant in their desire to become &ldquo;data-driven&rdquo;. Whether starting a digital transition, or just reacting to competition, many companies want to rely on data collection and analysis to guide them in making decisions. As the recent &ldquo;NewVantage&rdquo;&rdquo; Patners survey shows, &ldquo;Big Data and AI Executive Survey&rdquo;, most organizations fail to become &ldquo;data-driven&rdquo;.</p>

<p><p style="color:red"> &ldquo;72% of participants believe that they have not yet managed to forge a Data culture within their company &rdquo;  !</p>
Companies invest in the &ldquo;Data-driven&rdquo;, collaborate with experts in this field, start beautiful projects very ambitious and promising, but forget that their main obstacle remains the human factor.
The number of Chief Data Officers has increased from 12% in 2012 to 68% in 2018, the resources put in place by the companies are colossal, however companies have to overcome significant barriers to take advantage of these investments, and 93% among them consider that the main obstacle is embodied by the people and processes of their companies.<br />
According to Gartner analysts, by 2020 business investment in data projects is expected to exceed $200 billion globally, but more than 60 percent of &ldquo;data&rdquo; or &ldquo;big data&rdquo; projects will fail.</p>

<p><p style="color:red">  Who am I? </p></p>

<p><img src="/images/photo_mauriceteko.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I am Maurice TEKO, Data scientist. former statistician. I began my career as a consultant statistician in various pharmaceutical companies such as GlaxoSmithKlein, UCB, &hellip; Passionate about mathematics, these various experiences allowed me to apply many stochastic methods as Bayesian and frequentist in particular purpose to quantify the number of people likely to be infected, suspected and recovered during the onset of a pandemic at any time. I also participated in the implementation of phase <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> models epidemic and pandemic HxNy vaccines (H1N1, H5N3, H3N7, &hellip;). These traditional methods associated with many custom-made algorithms, I put them at the service of insurance companies, for strategic purposes, marketing evolution and digitization.</p>

<h1 id="2-how-do-we-work-at-quelea">2: How do we work at QueleA?</h1>

<p><img src="/images/comment_travaille_quelea.png" alt=" " /></p>

<!-- # un processus en quatres étapes -->

<p><img src="/images/un_processus_enquatre etapes_1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p style="color:red"> These four key steps are split into several key steps that summarize the philosophy of QueleA to establish a data driven culture. </p>

<p><img src="/images/un_processus_enquatre etapes_2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s meet and we&rsquo;ll have the pleasure to detail you all these processes.</p>

<h1 id="3-what-are-your-needs">3: What are your needs?</h1>

<p><img src="/images/comprendre_vos_besoins.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><p style="color:red"> QueleA !</p>
With more than 10 years in the business, I could see the passion of the analytics with the efforts and money allocated to this science. If the integration of analytics business processes is not something new, it is a trend that is democratized, it is a desire of users to see it integrated into their workflows. This integration is unfortunately not so easy as that, and is mainly hampered by habits and fixed mentalities, frightened by change. Passionate about mathematics and data, I have always been eager to put these skills at the service of business. Helping via modeling and data analysis to answer specific questions and problems of marketing, research and development, health, fraud, human resources or even mobility, has always been my source of motivation.
The objective of QueleA is simple as unique : To support you and help you to gradually introduce by a simple means a data culture in the company.</p>
